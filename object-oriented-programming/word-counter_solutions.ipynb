    "# Object Oriented Programming Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll implement a word counter class that can analyse some text and count the frequency of words in it. You should complete the class `WordCounter` below that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialises an attribute at instance creation time (in `__init__`) for storing the counts of word frequency.\n",
    "2. Has a method `count_words` that takes some text and counts the words in it. This method should take a single argument, a string.\n",
    "3. Has a method `frequency` that returns the number of occurrances of a word. This method should take a single argument, a string of the word being queried, and should return an integer.\n",
    "4. Has a method `top_words` that returns a list of the most common words. This method should take a single optional argument (defaulting to 1), an integer indicating the number of words to return, and should return a list of strings of the most frequent words, in descending order of frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, you should just split the input text by whitespace and count the occurrances of each string. Once this has done, you can try also making the counter case-insensitive and making it remove punctuation (specifically, all characters other than a-z and digits) from words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of this notebook you'll find some tests that you can run on the code that use your `WordCount` class to analyse the complete works of William Shakespeare, and compare your computed results against the expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find these resources from the Python standard library documentation useful:\n",
    "\n",

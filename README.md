## Faculty Fellowship training repository
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and python modules used to teach data science and engineering as part of the Faculty Fellowship.

Please do not commit any data to this repository. Data files may be uploaded to the publicly-accessible fellowship-teaching-materials S3 bucket. You can upload data to the bucket from the teaching-materials-data project on fellowship.my.faculty.ai.

Before commiting Jupyter notebooks, please ensure they are clean. You can do this using the Jupyter notebook menu ('Cell' -> 'All Output' -> 'Clear') or programatically with nb-clean.

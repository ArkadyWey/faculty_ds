    "* In fact, in a dataset of size N, the probability that any one data point is not included in the bootstrap sample used to train a given tree is $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)^N$. So, on average, in a bagged classifier with K base estimators, a given data point will not have been shown to $K\\cdot\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)^N$ base estimators during training. Since $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{N}\\right)^N\\approx e^{-1}$, we see that any given datum will not have encountered approximately $\\frac{K}{e}\\approx 0.37\\cdot K$ base estimators during training.\n",
    "* We can therefore use these $0.37\\cdot K$ base estimators to generate an essentially unbiased classification score prediction for our data point. Repeating this process N times, we can produce an essentially unbiased score for each point in the training set. Since we know the target variable for points in the training set, this lets us produce what is known as an **out of bag** (or **OOB**) estimate of our bagged classifier's performance.\n",
    "* Out of bag estimates are absolutely fantastic. Like cross validation, they let us estimate our model's generalisation accuracy (which helps us ensure that we don't overfit) using just the training that we have at hand.

One way to do this would be to use your bootstrapping code to bootstrap indices from `list(range(len(X_train))` which can then be used both to select data points from `X_train` for training trees as well as to record which poinst are selected , rather than sampling from `X_train` directly."

    "We've seen so far that bagging decision trees is a very powerful technique. This works fundamentally because decision trees trained on different bootstrapped datasets find different pathways to the truth, and so aggregating their predictions results in a 'wisdom of the crowds' type of benefit. Phrased technically: the base estimator decision trees are _decorrelated_. \n",
    "* Leo Breiman's Random Forests take this notion even further by ensuring that the decision trees have access only to randomly selected **partial information** whenever they create new nodes.\n",
    "* In a Random Forest, the base estimator decision trees are made even more decorrelated than in a bagged decision tree classifier by ensuring that they not only have access to different data sets during training but also different **features** at each stage of training.\n",
    "* Partially blinding the decision trees at each stage might impair them as individual learners, but the benefit of decorrelating their predictions makes up for this: indeed, [Concordet's Jury Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem) tells us that, if we were able to make the trees fully independent, then a Random Forest would become arbitrarily accurate as the number of trees  becomes larger.\n",
    "* Leo Breiman's original paper subsamples features at each split point by picking $\\mathrm{log}_2(F)$ features at each point, where $F$ is the total number of features available - the field has since found that the right number of feature to subsample can be problem specific. `sklearn` makes a variety of options available through the `max_features` option.\n",
    "* **Note**: the default setting for `max_features` for `RandomForestClassifier` objects in `sklearn` is a sensible default $\\mathrm{floor}(\\sqrt{F})$. However, the default `max_features` setting for `RandomForestRegressor` objects is $F$, so that no subsampling takes place! This is a mistake/ the result of a misunderstanding (as discussed [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/324370/references-on-number-of-features-to-use-in-random-forest-regression))- if you don't set this argument manaully then you'll simply be bagging decision trees regressors as opposed to training a Random Forest."

    "2. Use the `%%timeit` Jupyter cell magic command to time how long it takes a RandomForest with 100 trees to train. Compare this to how long it takes a bagged decision tree classifier with the same number of trees to train. What do you notice?\n",
    "    * You should notice that training a RandomForest is faster: this will always be the case, since there are fewer features to consider at each node when a new split is made. This can result in substantial speed improvements when a lot of features are present."

    "Random Forests are incredibly robust- they inherit all of the advantages of decision trees (handle mixed data types, correlated features, features on very different scales, fast to train) whilst also being stable, highly performant, needing very little parameter tuning (and even then, OOB examples make this easy!), whilst also providing an estimate of their generalisation accuracy for free. If you had to pick an algorithm to use in order to achieve good performance on a supervised learning task without knowing what the dataset would be beforehand and under time pressure, a Random Forest will almost certainly be the best option. No algorithm is perfect, however, and there are some situations where Random Forests will not perform excellently:\n",
    "* Very sparse or redundant high dimensional data: if a dataset has a huge number of features and very many of them are useless, the fact that Random Forest decision trees subsample features at each node will result in very weak base estimators and a low performing forest. This is relatively easy to diagnose, however: if you obtain poor OOB performance on a training set with very many features, set `max_features=None` to reduce your Random Forest to a standard bagged decision tree estimator and see if performance improves. If this is not computationally feasible, perform dimension reduction (try Principal Component Analysis as a cheap first option) in advance.\n",
    "* Very complicated, unstructured, high dimensional datasets like images and audio: in situations like this, feature engineering is essential and so tree based methods (which don't do any feature engineering) are poorly suited to this kind of situation. Use a neural network instead."

    "A crucial technique when boosting is that of *shrinkage* or *learning rate*. Given a trained model $f$, and a new model $h$ (the next boosting term) trained to predict the residual $y - f(X)$ (or to minimise a suitable cost function), the idea is to update $f$ by only a small multiple of $h$, $f + \\varepsilon\\cdot h$ (usually with $\\varepsilon$ quite small, say $\\varepsilon\\approx 0.1$ or $\\varepsilon\\approx 0.05$) rather than to perform a full update $f + h$. This is necessary, since  boosting models can overfit otherwise- error on the training set is minimised so quickly and efficiently by the boosted model that performance on the testing set has almost no chance to improve. Applying shrinkage when constructed a boosted model will often mean that more boosting iterations are required, but model performance will usually be better as a result.\n",
    "1. Add an extra boosting stage with shrinkage (use $\\varepsilon = 0.5$) to the 'hand made' boosted models that you have already constructed. That is, take the model `lasso + dt_res` that you have already trained, train a new decision tree, say `dt2`, to predict `y - lasso(X) - dt_res(X)` and then examine the performance of the model `lasso(X) + dt_res(X) + 0.5 * dt2(X)`. Do the same for the other simple sum of decision trees model."

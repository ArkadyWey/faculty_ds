    "# Forecast COVID19 admissions in England\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform a simple time series analysis and forecast to predict the daily number of COVID realted hospital admissions in England. The [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) package has several useful implementations of autogressive models. This notebook will explore how to generate forecasts and incorporate additioanl real time indicator information\n",

    "  * Daily and cumulative numbers of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital. Data are not updated every day by all four nations and the figures for Wales are not comparable to those for other nations as Wales include suspected COVID-19 patients while the other nations include only confirmed cases.\n",

    "* Cases (positive tests) by date reported, `newCasesByPublishDate`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Number of individuals who have had at least one positive COVID-19 test result (either lab-reported or lateral flow device), by date reported. Initially only pillar 1 tests (NHS and, in England, PHE labs) were included but commercial tests have been included from varying dates between 15th June and 14th July for each nation, leading to step increases in the numbers of cases reported at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tests conducted by Pillar, `newTestsByPublishDate`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Number of confirmed positive, negative or void COVID-19 test results. This is a count of test results and may include multiple tests for an individual person. Data for surveillance testing (pillar 4) are only available for the UK as a whole.\n",

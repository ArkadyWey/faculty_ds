    "The purpose of the following exercises is to gain familiarity with some core concepts underlying linear regression (as well as more sophisticated machine learning algorithms). You'll practice implementing gradient descent, coding models with the sklearn library, engineering features, and regularising. The dataset you'll use is [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and describes houses that were sold in Ames, Iowa. The modelling objective is to use available features to predict the sale price of a house."

    "**Gender recognition by voice - identify a voice as male or female**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you are going to use comes from a Kaggle competition. It contains measurements taken on 3,168 voice recordings, and the goal is to classify a data point as male or female. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is balanced and it contains a relatively small number of features: those are two conditions in which using SVMs could lead to good results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from choosing the kernel and tuning the hyper parameters, you should spend some time exploring the features and selecting only the ones you think are relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is stored in the file `voice.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To share their findings and approach, every team should prepare a very short presentation (max 4 minutes) to talk through at the end of the afternoon. \n",

    "**The Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following acoustic properties of each voice are measured and included within the CSV:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **meanfreq**: mean frequency (in kHz)\n",
    "* **sd**: standard deviation of frequency\n",
    "* **median**: median frequency (in kHz)\n",
    "* **Q25**: first quantile (in kHz)\n",
    "* **Q75**: third quantile (in kHz)\n",
    "* **IQR**: interquantile range (in kHz)\n",
    "* **skew**: skewness (see note in specprop description)\n",
    "* **kurt**: kurtosis (see note in specprop description)\n",
    "* **sp.ent**: spectral entropy\n",
    "* **sfm**: spectral flatness\n",
    "* **mode**: mode frequency\n",
    "* **centroid**: frequency centroid (see specprop)\n",
    "* **peakf**: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)\n",
    "* **meanfun**: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **minfun**: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **maxfun**: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **meandom**: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **mindom**: minimum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **maxdom**: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **dfrange**: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal\n",
    "* **modindx**: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacent measurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range\n",
    "* **label**: male or female"

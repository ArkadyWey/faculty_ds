Check whether the features are categorical or numerical values, is there a missing data in your columns, do you need to perform data normalisation. If you need help, check this website: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ . Note in case of categorical features you should convert them to *dummy* variables. This might be helpful: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html\n",

    "\n",
    "* Split the data into train and test set. The training data is used to train the classification model you choose, after which the model will be used to make predictions on the test dataset. Check: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html or if you are interested in more advanced data splitting, check: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html\n",

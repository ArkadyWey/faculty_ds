    "* Asymptotic formulae can work well if we know the right formula for each statistic. These can be very esoteric, however, and you have to either know or be able to compute the right formula in order to use it. What asymptotic formula should we use for the trimmed mean?\n",
    "* Given that the use classical or asymptotic techniques and estimates is impractical for the median and trimmed mean (which are the statistics which would actually be useful for us here, given their resistance to outliers), it seems that we're in trouble with asymptotics. How can we use these statistics if we're unable to estimate their accuracy?\n",
    "* The answer, as we've seen, is the bootstrap."
